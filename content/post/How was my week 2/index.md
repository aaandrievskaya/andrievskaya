## I couldn't imagine that

Well, I'll tell you everything in order.
My ankle has already begun to heal. I was already able to walk on my own, even go outside to the store. "How happy I am," I thought to myself.

This is how most of the week went. I really wanted to go to the parade dedicated to the Victory Day. and prst go for a walk on the May holidays, but I didn’t allow myself this, because I wasn’t completely healthy.

“The discharge is on Friday, from Monday I will finally be a full-fledged person,” I dreamed to myself. But my plans were not destined to come true, my leg began to hurt again, I again cannot afford to walk.

On Friday my doctor was very angry. He believes that I do not want to recover, so I deliberately loaded my leg and prolonged the illness. But that's not true, I really didn't think that I could damage the healed ligaments if I walked a little. I didn't even get hurt...

My sick leave has been extended for another 10 days, and I'm sitting at home, as if in prison. Although, perhaps this is for the best, because I had a lot of time to watch all the series and go through all the games that I left for the holidays... :)
