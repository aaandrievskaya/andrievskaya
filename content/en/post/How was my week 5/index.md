## My really busy week and thinks

So, another week is almost over. On it I visited for the last time all my couples in this academic year. It is sad? Maybe. But I was much sadder from how many debts I managed to collect during this time :)

And it would seem that this is not at all surprising. If you do not do the work, then it does not cease to exist from this. Everything is so, but the brain is cunning and lazy. I didn't admit it to myself. and now it's payback time.

Well, with the fact that it was in the 4th module that I stopped being an excellent student and lost an increased scholarship, I reconciled a long time ago. In general, I still think that pulling all the items to "5" would be like death and I would not have coped in any case. But in order to study for "4" you need to work a lot too)).

Yesterday I could hardly close the English language with ";", which I am very glad about. Ahead still favorite Operating systems and Technology of programming. To be honest, there is something to worry about, because I canâ€™t know until the very end how many points I can get. Everything is very difficult. But I'm ready to fight. Wish me good luck :)
