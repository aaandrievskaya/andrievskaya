## It is life

So, I will no longer pull and tell you what happened. On Wednesday, I was in a hurry to go home, as it was already quite late. I stumbled and twisted my leg. It didnâ€™t hurt me and at that moment I didnâ€™t attach any importance to it. However, already on Friday, the leg was very swollen and it was impossible to walk.
I had to go to the emergency room and explain the situation. Of course, there was no talk of attending a university. I was issued a sick leave and now I'm staying at home, away from all the interesting events...

However, perhaps this is for the best. During this time, I will miss all my friends enough and it will be doubly joyful to see them again! Also, from now on, I will be much more accurate, because I no longer want to experience this for myself.

Now my leg already feels much better and is gradually disappearing, so you donâ€™t have to worry, I will definitely return to the ranks !!!)
