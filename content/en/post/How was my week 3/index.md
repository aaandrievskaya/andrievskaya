## So life will pass - you will not notice

First of all, I report on the condition of my leg :) It is already healing, I am starting to walk again, although I am afraid (what if, due to stress, it will become inflamed again?).

On Tuesday I will be discharged, which I am incredibly happy about. Finally, my torment will end. I will be able to take a walk in the fresh air, I will be able to start exercising, I will be able to go to all the extra classes that I have not yet attended.

By the way, about this. On May 19, a vocal reporting concert was held, in which I could not take part, although I really wanted to. Words cannot describe how frustrating it is when you spent so much time preparing to present your creative work, but due to circumstances you cannot afford it. In fact, I could take a chance and perform, but there was a high probability of injuring my ankle again and I decided not to risk it.

Well, I hope that very soon my life will cease to be like Groundhog Day and I will again be a full-fledged person with an interesting life)
