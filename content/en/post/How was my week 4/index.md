## My busy week

First of all, as you already understood, I was discharged) I am again a full-fledged person of society! Almost...


The fact is that my leg has not fully healed, I still limp a lot. The doctor warned that the sprain could take a really long time to heal and I calmed down.


Well, now that I'm no longer at home, I have more to share with you! I attended OS pairs on Thursday and English on Friday.

On Thursday, I passed my debt on the report on the topic "User authentication scheme using logins and passwords." Ironically, on that day, scammers hacked into my Vkontakte account. It was a sad but priceless experience. After all, even knowing the whole theory of Internet security, I was still caught with the help of social engineering on a phishing link. Therefore, I urge you all to once again remember the safety rules and rational thinking. Don't repeat my mistakes!)

On Friday, I was glad to see the guys I sat down to miss so much. Unfortunately, there are a lot of debts in English that I have to complete in a week. But this is partly my fault, since I could do some tasks at home, but instead I decided to take a little vacation for myself ... Although, I donâ€™t regret anything :)

Well, that's where I'll end my report. See you in a week!
